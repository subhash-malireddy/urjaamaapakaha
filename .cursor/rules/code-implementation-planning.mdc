- When planning to implement a new feature, always
    - do not assume anything unless something is very very obvious
    - get clarified on any uncertainities 
    - get answers for any questions you have
    - always confirm if the plan looks good before jumping to implementation

- Some minimum rules while planning
    - always break the feature into smaller parts/jobs
    - each job can have one or multiple steps
    - each job/step shoould be able to be invidiually reviewed during implementation
    - keep the jobs/setps small for easy and efficient human review process
